## Analyzing Share Bikes

### Introduction:
Ford GoBike is a regional public bicycle sharing system in the San Francisco Bay Area, California. Beginning operation in August 29th 2013 as Bay Area Bike Share, the Ford GoBike system currently has over 2,600 bicycles in 262 stations across San Francisco, East Bay and San Jose. From it's early development, many other cities began adopting this system. This is the link for the dataset https://s3.amazonaws.com/fordgobike-data/index.html. This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the San Francisco Bay area. Our goal as a data analyst, is to increase it's rideship and to offer deals through the mobile app. What deals can be offered? Currently, it has three options: a flat price for a single one-way trip, a day pass that allows unlimited 30-minute rides for 24 hours and an annual membership. In addition to using bicycles, Ford has introduced electric bikes called Ford GoBike Plus (ebike) https://www.fordgobike.com/how-it-works/meet-the-bike. 

The Data Structure are as follows: Each trip is anonymized and includes:

- Trip Duration (seconds)
- Start Time and Date
- End Time and Date
- Start Station ID
- Start Station Name
- Start Station Latitude
- Start Station Longitude
- End Station ID
- End Station Name
- End Station Latitude
- End Station Longitude
- Bike ID
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
- Member Year of Birth
- Member Gender

Some of the questions that would be answered is:

Which of the age groups are taking more rides?
Which genders are taking more rides?
Most common duration of trip?


This project is on the FordGoBike data which is of year 2018 in the month of March.
